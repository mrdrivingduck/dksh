## About

It is a simple Linux shell program.

It supports:

* execute simple command like `ls`
* change the working directory by `cd`
* redirecting - `<` / `>`
* recursive piping - `|`

---

## Implementation Details

### Lexer

Trying to recognize the input and split them into tokens.

For unrecognized tokens, the lexer will make the shell ignoring the whole command.

* try to recognize the command character like `|` `<` `>`

* try to parse the whole string surrounded by `""` `''`

### Fork

The `exec()` system call will replace the whole process image to execute another program. In order to maintain the main process of the shell, before calling `exec()`, we need to use `fork()` system call to copy another process to execute the command.

However, for `cd` command, it changes the working directory in the _PCB_ of the main process by calling `chdir()`. So it is not necessary to fork another process before calling `chdir()`.

### Redirecting

For commands need to be redirected, the shell will open a file descriptor for the redirecting target. Then, the program override the file descriptor `0` (`STDIN`) or `1` (`STDOUT`) with the opening file descriptor, by calling `dup2()` system call. As a result, the input or output of the program will be redirected.

### Pipe && Process Chain

Pipe is used to pipe the output of one process to the input of another process. 

The command before `|` character should be executed in a forked process. Before calling `fork()`, a pipe should be created using `pipe()` system call first. Then, after calling `fork()`, the child process overrides the `STDOUT` with output file descriptor of the pipe; the origin process overrides the `STDIN` with input file descriptor of the pipe. As a result, the output of the child process will be piped as the input of the origin process.

For commands using multiple pipes, a process chain will be created. The program should be implemented in a recursive way. Specifically, the command is parsed in an reverse order: commands in front of the `|` will be executed by a newly forked process.

For example:

```shell
$ cat <input.txt | sort | uniq | cat >output.txt
```

The main process will fork a process _p1_ to execute `cat >output.txt`; _p1_ will fork a _p2_ to execute `uniq` and wating for the result from _p2_ . Then _p2_ will fork _p3_ for `sort`, and _p3_ will fork _p4_ to execute `cat <input.txt`.
